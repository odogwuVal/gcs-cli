// rootCmd represents the base command when called without any subcommands
var rootCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "gcscli",
	Short: "CLI tool for managing files in Google Cloud Storage (GCS)",

	Long: `This CLI tool allows developers to upload files to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) 
and get the content of GCS bucket, essentially to confirm that the upload was succesful.

Example Usage:

- Upload a file to a specific GCS path:
gcscli upload -p <object path in the bucket> -o <file name in the bucket> -f <path to file> bucket-name

- get files attributes in a GCS bucket or path if it exists:
gcscli get -bucketname <bucket-name> -o <target-path>
